# tap-rest-api-msdk

`tap-rest-api-msdk` is a Singer tap for generic rest-apis. The novelty of this particular tap
is that it will auto-discover the stream's schema.

This is particularly useful if you have a stream with a very large and complex schema or
a stream that outputs records with varying schemas for each record. Can also be used for
simpler more reliable streams.

There are many forms of Authentication supported by this tap. By default for legacy support, you can pass Authentication via headers. If you want to use the built in support for Authentication, this tap supports
- Basic Authentication
- API Key
- Bearer Token
- OAuth

Please note that OAuthJWTAuthentication has not been developed. If you are interested in contributing this, please fork and make a pull request. 

Built with the Meltano [SDK](https://gitlab.com/meltano/sdk) for Singer Taps.

Gratitude goes to [anelendata](https://github.com/anelendata/tap-rest-api) for inspiring this "SDK-ized" version of their tap.

## Configuration

### Accepted Config Options


A full list of supported settings and capabilities for this
tap is available by running:

```bash
tap-rest-api-msdk --about
```

#### Top-level config options. 
Parameters that appear at the stream-level will overwrite their top-level 
counterparts except where noted in the stream-level params. Otherwise, the values
provided at the top-level will be the default values for each stream.:

- `oauth_extras`: optional: see authentication params below.
- `oauth_expiration_secs`: optional: see authentication params below.

#### Stream level config options. 
Parameters that appear at the stream-level
will overwrite their top-level counterparts except where noted below:
- `name`: required: name of the stream.
- `path`: optional: the path appended to the `api_url`.
- `params`: optional: an object of objects that provide the `params` in a `requests.get` method.
  Stream level params will be merged with top-level params with stream level params overwriting 
  top-level params with the same key.
- `headers`: optional: an object of headers to pass into the api calls. Stream level
  headers will be merged with top-level params with stream level params overwriting 
  top-level params with the same key
- `records_path`: optional: a jsonpath string representing the path in the requests response that contains the records to process. Defaults to `$[*]`.
- `primary_keys`: required: a list of the json keys of the primary key for the stream.
- `replication_key`: optional: the json key of the replication key. Note that this should be an incrementing integer or datetime object.
- `except_keys`: This tap automatically flattens the entire json structure and builds keys based on the corresponding paths.
  Keys, whether composite or otherwise, listed in this dictionary will not be recursively flattened, but instead their values will be
  turned into a json string and processed in that format. This is also automatically done for any lists within the records; therefore,
  records are not duplicated for each item in lists.
- `num_inference_keys`: optional: number of records used to infer the stream's schema. Defaults to 50.
- `schema`: optional: A valid Singer schema or a path-like string that provides
  the path to a `.json` file that contains a valid Singer schema. If provided, 
  the schema will not be inferred from the results of an api call.
- `start_date`: optional: used by the **hateoas_body** request style. This is an initial starting date for an incremental replication if there is no
  existing state provided for an incremental replication. Example format 2022-06-10:23:10:10+1200.
- `search_parameter`: optional: used by the **hateoas_body** request style. This is a search/query parameter used by the API for an incremental replication. 
  The difference between the `replication_key` and the `search_parameter` is the search parameter is the field name used in request parameters whereas the 
  replication_key is the name of the field in the API reponse. Example if the search_paramter = **last-updated** the generate schema from the api 
  might be **meta_lastUpdated**. The replication_key is set to meta_lastUpdated, and the search_parameter to last-updated.
- `search_prefix`: optional: used by the **hateoas_body** request style. If used it should be in conjunction with a `search_parameter`. The search prefix is
  prepended to search parameter to describe the search operation. Example a search_prefix = **gt** means results Greater Than the given search parameter. 
  Other examples of search parameter **eq** = Equal To, **lt** Less Than. See your API guide for valid search prefixes. Example: search_parameter=last-updated, the 
  search_prefix = gt, current replication state = 2022-08-10:23:10:10+1200 creates a request parameter **last-updated=gt2022-06-10:23:10:10+1200**.

#### Top-Level Authentication config options.
- `auth_method`: optional: The method of authentication used by the API. Supported options
  include:
  - **oauth**: for OAuth2 authentication
  - **basic**: Basic Header authorization - base64-encoded username + password config items
  - **api_key**: for API Keys in the header e.g. X-API-KEY.
  - **bearer_token**: for Bearer token authorization.
  - Defaults to no_auth which will take authentication parameters passed via the headers config.
- `api_keys`: optional: A dictionary of API Key/Value pairs used by the api_key auth method
  Example: { "X-API-KEY": "my secret value"}.
- `client_id`: optional: Used for the OAuth2 authentication method. The public application ID
  that's assigned for Authentication. The **client_id** should accompany a **client_secret**.
- `client_secret`: optional: Used for the OAuth2 authentication method. The client_secret is a
  secret known only to the application and the authorization server. It is essential the
  application's own password.
- `username`: optional: Used for a number of authentication methods that use a user
  password combination for authentication.
- `password`: optional: Used for a number of authentication methods that use a user password
  combination for authentication.
- `bearer_token`: optional: Used for the Bearer Authentication method, which uses a token as part
  of the authorization header for authentication.
- `refresh_token`: optional: An OAuth2 Refresh Token is a string that the OAuth2 client can use to
  get a new access token without the user's interaction.
- `grant_type`: optional: Used for the OAuth2 authentication method. The grant_type is required
  to describe the OAuth2 flow. Flows support by this tap include **client_credentials**, **refresh_token**, **password**.
- `scope`: optional: Used for the OAuth2 authentication method. The scope is optional, it is a
  mechanism to limit the amount of access that is granted to an access token. One or more scopes
  can be provided delimited by a space.
- `access_token_url`: optional: Used for the OAuth2 authentication method. This is the end-point
  for the authentication server used to exchange the authorization codes for a access token.
- `redirect_uri`: optional: Used for the OAuth2 authentication method. This optional as the
  redirect_uri may be part of the token returned by the authentication server. If a redirect_uri
  is provided, it determines where the API server redirects the user after the user completes the
  authorization flow.
- `oauth_extras`: optional: A object of Key/Value pairs for additional oauth config parameters
  which may be required by the authorization server. Example: { "resource": "https://analysis.windows.net/powerbi/api" }.
- `oauth_expiration_secs`: optional: Used for OAuth2 authentication method. This optional setting
  is a timer for the expiration of a token in seconds. If not set the OAuth will use the default
  expiration set in the token by the authorization server.

#### Complex Authentication

The previous section showed out of the box methods for a single factor of authentication e.g. x-api-key, basic or oauth. If the API requires multiple forms of authentication, you may need to pass some of the authentication methods via the headers to be be combined with the main auth_method.

Example:
An API may use OAuth2 for authentication but also requires an X-API-KEY to be supplied as well. In this situation pass the X-API-KEY as part of the `headers` config, and the rest of the config should be set for OAuth e.g.

- headers = '{"x-api-key": "my_secret_api_key"}'
- auth_method = "oauth"
- grant_type = "client_credentials"
- access_token_url = "https://auth.example.server/oauth2/token"
- client_id = "my_example_client_id"
- client_secret = "my_example_client_secret"

Some servers may require additional information like a `Request-Context` which is usually Base64 encoded. If this is the case it should be included in the `headers` config as well.

Example:

- headers = '{"x-api-key": "my_secret_api_key", "Request-Context": "my_example_Base64_encoded_json_object"}'

## Pagination
API Pagination is a complex topic as there is no real single standard, and many different implementations.  Unless options are provided, both the request and results style type default to the `default`, which is the pagination style originally implemented.

### Default Request Style
The default request style for pagination is described below:
- Use next_page_token_path if provided to extract the token from response if found; otherwise
- use X-Next-Page header from response

### Default Response Style
The default response style for pagination is described below:
- If there is a token, add that as a `page` URL parameter.

### Additional Request Styles
There are additional request styles supported as follows for pagination.
- `style1` - This style uses URL parameters named offset and limit
  - `offset` is calculated from the previous response, or not set if there is no previous response
  - `limit` is set to the `pagination_page_size` value, if specified, or not set
- `hateoas_body` - This style parses the next_token response for the parameters to pass.
  - The parameters are dynamic
  - Is used by API's utilising the HATEOAS Rest style [HATEOAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS), including [FHIR API's](https://hl7.org/fhir/http.html).

### Additional Response Styles
There are additional response styles supported as follows.
- `style1` - This style retrieves pagination information from the `pagination` top-level element in the response.  Expected format is as follows:
    ```json
    "pagination": {
        "total": 136,
        "limit": 2,
        "offset": 2
    }
    ```
  The next page token, which in this case is really the next starting record number, is calculated by the limit, current offset, or None is returned to indicate no more data.  For this style, the response style _must_ include the limit in the response, even if none is specified in the request, as well as total and offset to calculate the next token value.

- `hateoas_body` - This style requires a well crafted `next_page_token_path` configuration 
  parameter to retrieve the request parameters from the GET request response for a subsequent request. The following example extracts the URL for the next pagination page.
    ```json
    "next_page_token_path": "$.link[?(@.relation=='next')].url."
    ```
  The following example demonstrates the power of JSONPath extensions by further splitting the URL and extracting just the parameters. Note: This is not required for FHIR API's but is provided for illustration of added functionality for complex use cases.
    ```json
    "next_page_token_path": "$.link[?(@.relation=='next')].url.`split(?, 1, 1)`"
    ```       
  The [JSONPath Evaluator](https://jsonpath.com/) website is useful to test the correct json path expression to use.

  Example json response from a FHIR API.


    ```json
    {
      "resourceType": "Bundle",
      "id": "44f2zf06-g53c-4218-a3ef-08bb6c2fde4a",
      "meta": {
        "lastUpdated": "2022-06-28T18:25:01.165+12:00"
      },
      "type": "searchset",
      "total": 63,
      "link": [
        {
          "relation": "self",
          "url": "https://myexample_fhir_api_url/base_folder/ExampleService?_count=10&_getpageoffset=10&services-provided-type=MY_INITIAL_EXAMPLE_SERVICE"
        },
        {
          "relation": "next",
          "url": "https://myexample_fhir_api_url/base_folder?_getpages=44f2zf06-g53c-4218-a3ef-08bb6c2fde4a&_getpagesoffset=10&_count=10&_pretty=true&_bundletype=searchset"
        }
      ],
      "entry": [
        {
          "fullUrl": "https://myexample_fhir_api_url/base_folder/ExampleService/example-service-123456",
          "resource": {
            "resourceType": "ExampleService",
            "id": "example-service-123456"
          }
        }
      ]
  }
    ```

  Note: If you wish to extract the body from example GET request response above the following configuration parameter `records_path` will return the actual json content.
  ```json
  "records_path": "$.entry[*].resource"
  ```
